# Mess with Node in Docker

I want to set up a Node application that runs in Docker and that I can debug from VS Code.

Then I'd like to implement both development and production branches of this behavior. I think that will mean multi-stage Docker builds for compact deployment containers.

Then I'd like to try this with a Next.js app, which changes the nature of how you build and run.
